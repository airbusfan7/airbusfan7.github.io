         Activating a speed camera on the way to Frankfurt Airport, my Mom, her best friend and I were ready to start this adventure. The farewell
         was short and painless (for me). The Security check was fast and professional.  Without really having time to use the duty-free shops, we started to
         board the Flight AC 873 heading to Toronto. It was the C-FIUL. Luckily, I had a window seat. I found it quite surprising that free drinks were
         served. The pasta was ok, I didn’t really expect anything. At “Immigration and Customs Canada” I had to give out my customs declaration. The 
         officer asked me to tell him what food I had with me, he accepted chocolate, but didn’t know “Haribo”. After spelling and describing what
         “Haribo" he let me cross the border. Then we had to wait roughly 2hours to get our other documents checked. As stupid as I am, I told my
         friend to go first. And then we had to go to another section where we had to wait again, and I would have been the next one to get to a counter
         finally I was through with all this paper stuff, and went to get my baggage. Surprisingly there wasn’t written on which band the luggage from 
         Frankfurt would be. When everybody had his luggage, we directly headed to the CN Tower. It's huge. Luckily, we didn't have to wait so long to
         get inside, but there we had to wait quite a time until we got into the elevator. The view was breathtaking. On the first level there was a part
         with a glass floor. Quite a challenge to step on it . The dinner was in a Sportsbar, where I had my first chicken fingers, not bad, but I hope to get
         better ones during my stay. Being in the Hotel again, some of us meet to look for the pool. Unfortunately, the pool at the top of the Chelsea
         Hotel was closed for minors and the pool for everybody wasn’t open. We returned sadly and tired to our rooms. I tried to continue being awake as my goal was to stay awake
         for 24 hours, but I failed.<br />
         <b>The next day</b> we had to get up early, have a breakfast and off we went towards the Niagara Falls. It’s unbelievable how much water is going 
         past those to falls every second. After I tour on the Hornblower, I didn’t made pictures off, as I wanted to protect my gear. And there was no 
         chance to take great Photos, as there was a huge water cloud. You have to experience it by yourself. At the Niagara I ate my first Hot Dog from
         a Street seller. </p>
