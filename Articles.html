        Activating a speed camera on the way to Frankfurt Airport, my Mom, her best friend and I were ready to start this adventure. <br />
        The farewe was short and painless (for me). The Security check was fast and professional.  Without really having time to use the duty-free shops,<br />
        we started to board the Flight AC 873 heading to Toronto. It was the C-FIUL. Luckily, I had a window seat. I found it quite surprising <br />
        that free drinks were served. The pasta was ok, I didn’t really expect anything. At “Immigration and Customs Canada” I had to give out my customs declaration. <br />
        The officer asked me to tell him what food I had with me, he accepted chocolate, but didn’t know “Haribo”. After spelling what“Haribo"  and describing what it is <br />
        he let me cross the border. Then we had to wait roughly 2hours to get our other documents checked. As stupid as I am, I told myfriend to go first. <br />
        And then we had to go to another section where we had to wait again, and I would have been the next one to get to a counter. <br />
        Finally I was through with all this paper stuff, and went to get my baggage. Surprisingly there wasn’t written on which band the luggage from Frankfurt would be.<br />
        When everybody had his luggage, we directly headed to the CN Tower. It's huge. Luckily, we didn't have to wait so long toget inside, <br />
        but there we had to wait quite a time until we got into the elevator. The view was breathtaking. On the first level there was a part with a glass floor.<br />
        Quite a challenge to step on it. The dinner was in a Sportsbar, where I had my first chicken fingers, not bad, but I hope to get better ones during my stay. <br />
        Being in the Hotel again, some of us meet to look for the pool. Unfortunately, the pool at the top of the Chelsea Hotel was closed for minors <br />
        and the pool for everybody wasn’t open. We returned sadly and tired to our rooms. I tried to continue being awake as my goal was to stay awake for 24 hours, but I failed.<br />
        <b>The next day</b> we had to get up early, have a breakfast and off we went towards the Niagara Falls. It’s unbelievable how much water is going past those to falls every second. <br />
        After I tour on the Hornblower, I didn’t made pictures off, as I wanted to protect my gear. And there was no chance to take great Photos, as there was a huge water cloud.<br />
        You have to experience it by yourself. At the Niagara I ate my first Hot Dog from a Street seller. in the evening we ate again in a sports bar, where we were able to try Root beer, <br />
        which  tastes like Listerine. Not my favorite, but I'll have to get used to it. after everyone wasn't hungry anymore, we went to the harbor, where we had a boat tour through the <a class="Link" href="/Gallery#Toronto" type="_blank"> Islands </a>
        Getting back in the Hotel, our group from yesterday meet again to try our luck with the pool and it worked! of course it wasn't the best, but appropriate. <br />
        Unfortunately, we had to get up quite early in the morning, because we had an orientation meeting with some Canadiens. I didn’t learn something new as it was only repetition of the guidelines.<br />
        Full of excitement we set off to the airport, where we split and everyone went to their final destination, for me Vancouver. My Self-Check-in didn’t work how it was supposed to do,<br />
        so I had to stay in a line for quite a long time. <i>Waiting should get an Olympic discipline </i>The safety check was worse than in Frankfurt, <br />
        as I was quite surprised that we didn’t had to take out all our electric stuff.  I got myself a wrap while the others were enjoying their burgers. <br />
        The flight to Vancouver (5hr) was a pleasant experience, as we had, surprisingly, an Inflight Entertaiment. Once arrived in Vancouver, we were picked up my a and driven to our host families. <br />
        As we got closer the excitement grew.<br />
    </p>

    <h1 id="Vancouver1">My First Weeks in Vancouver</h1>
    <p>
        <b> Then finally, I arrived.</b> My Host mother directly hugged me and Maylo, the dog, was excited, too. My Room is nice, but I don’t really use  it. <br />
        In the Evening, my sister had her friends coming over, and so I directly made some friends. One iss a mountain biker too. We want down to Chevron, a gas station, where we got our selves some sweets.<br />
        I directly meet the family’s foster son . Later the night I was trying to hold my self-awake, but it didn’t work. I slept ten seconds got up and that several times until I stopped refusing going to bed. <br />
        The next day my host mother didn’t work, so she showed my everything important. The next day I had to go to school to get another orientation and meet my Guardian. He seems to be nice. <br />
        We had to write a test about our most challenging experience, and I failed, so I got in a course with other internationals who nearly only speak Spanish. The following days were still vacation <br />
        and I didn’t do something really important.<br />
        <b>The first day of school </b> I had a Homeroom routine, which means just giving back forms and get more information. Then came the first days of real school.<br />
        I changed some classes in the first two weeks and that is now my final schedule: Chemistry 11, Metalwork, Physics 11, BC Culture, English, Pre-Calculus 12, Electronics, Woodwork.<br />
        They are rotating, and ones the system is understood, it’s simple. I walk to school at 7:55 and then at 3:00 home.  Sometimes I walk alone, on other days I walk with my sister and her friends.<br />
        Depends on whether they have got choir or study block. My school offers a <a class="Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gYg1v-TTBI" target="_blank "> Drag Race club </a> and I directly joined. We’ll go on a field trip to a drag strip on September,28. I’m getting excited and nervous, <br />
        as the passenger seat is about to be installed. I, as a not-experienced car mechanic, help where I can.<br />
        One day we had fire drill and direct following a lock down, which is the standard procedure when someone with a gun is in the building. We heard stories about lock downs. <br />
        which lasted up to five hours, which means five hours no movement, silence. Luckily, we had only 15minutes of lock down. On the weekend and after school, I try to go out for a ride,<br />
        but as I’m not reckless, it depends on my friends when they have time. I just got a used <a class="Link" href="/Gallery#Biking" target="_blank"> Bike </a> here. I already hit <a class="Link" href="https://youtu.be/sCL7RCeBXnw" target="_blank">
            Pangor

        and <a class="Link" href="https://youtu.be/qQOSVbjvngA" target="_blank"> John Deer </a>. <br />
        All fun trails here.

        Finally, it is Sept 28, my mom’s birthday, I get up extra early, because it’s Track Day! We meet, load the car on the trailer and head to Mission, BC. When leaving the school, we drive past many students who have school,<br />
        while we are destroying the environment. As there is a lot of traffic in the greater Vancouver area, there are extra lines, for vehicles, which carry at least two passengers. Quite neat! <br />
        Once arrived, we had to go and check out the other cars, there was a lot of money at the strip. After passing the mandatory check, our car goes in the lineup. In the meantime, those who aren’t driving go and watch the races.<br />
        Then finally it’s time for our car. Having to be above 14 sec with two persons in the car, the teacher, releases the thrust quite early. We build in a passenger seat, so that everyone, who has the papers signed and is 16 or older, can go with the car. <br />
        For one girl, it is her first time driving the car and of course I get the camera out to take pictures of her first solo race. She is fast, at finish up to 160km/h. There are two or three vehicles to cross the line with speeds over 300km/h. One of those is a motorcycle!<br />
        I personally find the smoky burn outs, and wheelies more interesting, that’s why I focus on pictures during the lineup and launch. After a nice, but tough day, we head back home. It’s the rush hour Vancouver is famous for, luckily, I can sleep nearly the whole time standing in traffic.<br />
        The Dad driving was very nice, and the car,he drove, was huge.
    </p>
    <h1 id="School">School</h1> <p>
        In School we’ve got day one and day two.

        On day one I've got <b>Chemistry</b>, by Mr. Farell. He is a nice Teacher, but he course is hard. He always goes through a PowerPoint presentation, explaining us what we need to know for the next test. He doesn’t teach like I’m used to be taught, but his way is better. <br />
        He just says, if you don’t understand something, go on my <a class="Link" href="https://farrellnorthvan.weebly.com/period-1.html" target="_blank">
            website
        </a> to see the notes, or go and ask me. After the 15 minutes brake and the announcements,<br />
        I’ve got <b> Metalwork </b>. Mr. Lonsbrough, the Electronics and Drag Race teacher, teaches Metalwork as well. Our first project is a hammer, I decided to make a small duty hammer. On the Lathe, I shape the form out of a 1” steel. Now I practice <a class="Link" href="https://youtu.be/iub37UzAu8w" target="_blank">
            brazing
        </a>, as I want to make some gold accents on my hammer. <br />
        In <b>Physics</b>, Mr. Tadey explains the us how objects move (Kinetics). We have to hand everything in, but that’s no big deal. Physics is the only class, I’ve together with my sister and my friends. In Lunchbreak, we can do what we want, use the cafeteria or go to Chevron and get some sweets.<br />
        My last class on day one is <b> Social Studies </b> by Mr. Dang. He is a nice teacher, trying to discuss demographics with us. Usually day one is the day with less homework, means biking after school.<br /><br />
        On Day two, I start with English with Mrs. Deminger. We discuss Julius Caesar, written by Shakespeare himself. Every assignment, we have to hand in, must be typed. I wish in Germany it was the same. <br />
        I have to attend <b> Pre-Calculus 12 </b>, run my Mrs. Martin, because this is the only course, which is on a similar level as German Mathematics, but we started with graphing functions and their roots. <br />
        Pre-Calc 12 is followed by <b> Electronics </b>. We are building sumo-bots, for which we 3D-Print the gearboxes. We started the course with building labs, to recall how the different parts as resistors, transistors, … are used properly. <br />
        My last Period on day two is Woodwork, where Mr. Vansamang shows us how to operate the different saws.I don't know my project yet.On day two, I usually get a too much homework to go riding.
