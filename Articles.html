        Activating a speed camera on the way to Frankfurt Airport, my Mom, her best friend and I were ready to start this adventure. <br />
        The farewe was short and painless (for me). The Security check was fast and professional.  Without really having time to use the duty-free shops,<br />  
        we started to board the Flight AC 873 heading to Toronto. It was the C-FIUL. Luckily, I had a window seat. I found it quite surprising <br />
        that free drinks were served. The pasta was ok, I didn’t really expect anything. At “Immigration and Customs Canada” I had to give out my customs declaration. <br />
        The officer asked me to tell him what food I had with me, he accepted chocolate, but didn’t know “Haribo”. After spelling what“Haribo"  and describing what it is <br />
        he let me cross the border. Then we had to wait roughly 2hours to get our other documents checked. As stupid as I am, I told myfriend to go first. <br />
        And then we had to go to another section where we had to wait again, and I would have been the next one to get to a counter. <br />
        Finally I was through with all this paper stuff, and went to get my baggage. Surprisingly there wasn’t written on which band the luggage from Frankfurt would be.<br />
        When everybody had his luggage, we directly headed to the CN Tower. It's huge. Luckily, we didn't have to wait so long toget inside, <br />
        but there we had to wait quite a time until we got into the elevator. The view was breathtaking. On the first level there was a part with a glass floor.<br />
        Quite a challenge to step on it. The dinner was in a Sportsbar, where I had my first chicken fingers, not bad, but I hope to get better ones during my stay. <br />
        Being in the Hotel again, some of us meet to look for the pool. Unfortunately, the pool at the top of the Chelsea Hotel was closed for minors <br />
        and the pool for everybody wasn’t open. We returned sadly and tired to our rooms. I tried to continue being awake as my goal was to stay awake for 24 hours, but I failed.<br />
        <b>The next day</b> we had to get up early, have a breakfast and off we went towards the Niagara Falls. It’s unbelievable how much water is going past those to falls every second. <br />
        After I tour on the Hornblower, I didn’t made pictures off, as I wanted to protect my gear. And there was no chance to take great Photos, as there was a huge water cloud.<br />
        You have to experience it by yourself. At the Niagara I ate my first Hot Dog from a Street seller. in the evening we ate again in a sports bar, where we were able to try Root beer, <br />
        which  tastes like Listerine. Not my favorite, but I'll have to get used to it. after everyone wasn't hungry anymore, we went to the harbor, where we had a boat tour through the <a id="Link"href="/Gallery#Toronto" type="_blank"> Islands </a>
        Getting back in the Hotel, our group from yesterday meet again to try our luck with the pool and it worked! of course it wasn't the best, but appropriate. <br />
        Unfortunately, we had to get up quite early in the morning, because we had an orientation meeting with some Canadiens. I didn’t learn something new as it was only repetition of the guidelines.<br />
        Full of excitement we set off to the airport, where we split and everyone went to their final destination, for me Vancouver. My Self-Check-in didn’t work how it was supposed to do,<br />
        so I had to stay in a line for quite a long time. <i>Waiting should get an Olympic discipline </i>The safety check was worse than in Frankfurt, <br />
        as I was quite surprised that we didn’t had to take out all our electric stuff.  I got myself a wrap while the others were enjoying their burgers. <br />
        The flight to Vancouver (5hr) was a pleasant experience, as we had, surprisingly, an Inflight Entertaiment. Once arrived in Vancouver, we were picked up my a and driven to our host families. <br />
        As we got closer the excitement grew.<br />
        <b> Then finally, I arrived.</b> My Host mother directly hugged me and Maylo, the dog, was excited, too. My Room is nice, but I don’t really use  it. <br />
        In the Evening, my sister had her friends coming over, and so I directly made some friends. One iss a mountain biker too. We want down to Chevron, a gas station, where we got our selves some sweets.<br />
        I directly meet the family’s foster son . Later the night I was trying to hold my self-awake, but it didn’t work. I slept ten seconds got up and that several times until I stopped refusing going to bed. <br />
       The next day my host mother didn’t work, so she showed my everything important. The next day I had to go to school to get another orientation and meet my Guardian. He seems to be nice. <br />
       We had to write a test about our most challenging experience, and I failed, so I got in a course with other internationals who nearly only speak Spanish. The following days were still vacation <br />
        and I didn’t do something really important.<br />
        <b>The first day of school </b> I had a Homeroom routine, which means just giving back forms and get more information. Then came the first days of real school.<br />
        I changed some classes in the first two weeks and that is now my final schedule: Chemistry 11, Metalwork, Physics 11, BC Culture, English, Pre-Calculus 12, Electronics, Woodwork.<br />
        They are rotating, and ones the system is understood, it’s simple. I walk to school at 7:55 and then at 3:00 home.  Sometimes I walk alone, on other days I walk with my sister and her friend.<br />
        Depends on whether they have got choir or study block. My school offers a <a id="Link"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gYg1v-TTBI" type="_blank"> Drag Race club </a> and I directly joined. We’ll go on a field trip to a drag strip on September,28. I’m getting excited and nervous, <br />
        as the passenger seat is about to be installed. I, as a not-experienced car mechanic, help where I can.<br />
        One day we had fire drill and direct following a lock down, which is the standard procedure when someone with a gun is in the building. We heard stories about lock downs. <br />
        which lasted up to five hours, which means five hours no movement, silence. Luckily, we had only 15minutes of lock down. On the weekend and after school, I try to go out for a ride,<br />
        but as I’m not reckless, it depends on my friend when he has time. I just got a used <a id="Link"href=”/Galery#Biking”> Bike </a> here. I already hit <a id="Link" href=” https://www.trailforks.com/trails/boogieman/ “>  Boogieman </a> and <a href=” https://www.trailforks.com/trails/john-deer/ ” > John Deer </a>. <br />
        Both fun trails.
